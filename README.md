# Sparta ruby loops lab

In this folder I used the different loops available in Ruby, and use RSpec to test whether I receive the correct value back.

### Running the tests

To run the RSpec tests, while in the root directory, in the terminal:
```
cd loops-stater-code
```
followed by:
```
rspec
```
